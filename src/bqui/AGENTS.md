# bqui — agent notes

*Last verified against `9cbe4cb` (2026-07-20).*

Internals, entry points, and traps for the UI toolkit. Concepts and usage are in
`readme.md`; project-wide conventions are in the top-level `docs/`. This file is
the index for `bqui`; split topics into a `.agent/` folder here if it outgrows
one file.

## Widget pipeline

`Widget → Builder → Element → Instance`, each stage lowering the description
toward drawable state (`widget/`):

- `AnyWidget = Widget<std::function<AnyBuilder(BuildParams)>>` — the user-facing,
  type-erased description.
- `Builder` receives `BuildParams` (theme, environment) and produces size hints.
- `Element` (`AnyElement = Element<AnySignal<Instance>>`) wires up signals and
  receives the resolved size.
- `Instance` is the realised widget: its render tree, input areas, hit regions.

Modifiers are `AnyWidgetModifier` joined with `operator|`. They exist at each
pipeline level (widget/builder/element/instance modifiers in `modifier/`), so a
modifier can act wherever it needs to.

## Shapes

Two layers (`shape/`): `avg::ShapeFunction` is the animatable engine;
`bqui::shape::Shape<T>` is an **rvalue-chained** builder wrapping a signal of it.
Transforms/composition return a new `Shape`; `fill`/`stroke`/`fillAndStroke`
terminate to `AnyWidget`. Transforms are **paint-time and never affect layout**
(the layout axis is separate — `docs/decisions.md`).

## Layout, environment, animation

- Layout: size hints (min/natural/stretch) negotiated by containers; `gravity`
  aligns within allocated space. Size hints are signals.
- Environment: a typed, scoped store threaded through the tree (`provider/`,
  `modifier/setparams.h`); `Theme` is the common parameter.
- Animation: `withanimation.h` (guard or lambda form) marks changes to animate.

## Traps

- `Widget`/`Element`/the modifiers have **no `extern template` declaration and
  no explicit instantiation** — every translation unit instantiates them
  implicitly. GCC cannot export a specialization these classes name inside their
  own bodies, and a Release build hides that, so don't add one back; the
  gcc-12/clang-11 Debug legs are what catch it (see `docs/conventions.md`).
- Shape builder methods are `&&`-qualified — call other `&&` overloads via
  `std::move(*this)`. A parameterless shape can't use `merge()`; it's built as a
  constant (the `if constexpr (sizeof...(Ts) == 0)` branch in `shape/shape.h`).
- Builder-style template APIs are guarded by an instantiation smoke test
  (`test/shapetest.cpp`) — extend it when adding builder methods.
- Geometry recovered from input areas (`test/layouttest.cpp`) says nothing about
  the render tree: a node placed wrongly, one that cannot be drawn at all, or
  one paired with the wrong sibling across an update all leave the input areas
  intact. Anything that only manifests when drawing belongs in
  `test/rendertreetest.cpp`, which splices realised instances the way the window
  loop does and asserts on the `avg::Drawing` that comes out.

For cross-cutting rules (the `Any` convention, include-dir firewall, symbol
visibility) see `docs/conventions.md`; do not restate them here.
